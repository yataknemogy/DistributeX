# DistributeX

## Overview

DistributeX is a highly scalable, distributed computing platform designed to handle large-scale computation tasks across
multiple nodes. The platform dynamically balances the load, optimizes task distribution, and utilizes predictive
analytics to enhance performance and prevent bottlenecks.

## Features

- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Efficiently distributes tasks across nodes based on real-time metrics.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easily scale the platform horizontally to handle increased load.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Uses historical data and machine learning to forecast potential bottlenecks and optimize
  task allocation.
- **Task Scheduling**: Implements advanced task scheduling algorithms to ensure high performance and low latency.
- **Monitoring and Analytics**: Provides detailed monitoring and analysis of system performance with real-time alerts.

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: For building the backend services and task execution nodes.
- **gRPC**: For high-performance communication between microservices.
- **Redis**: For distributed caching of results and task states.
- **Prometheus & Grafana**: For monitoring system metrics and visualization.
- **Kafka**: For handling real-time data streams and task queues.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yataknemogy/DistributeX.git
    ```
   
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   go mod download
    ```
   
3. Start the system by launching the Task Manager:
   ```
    go run cmd/taskmanager/main.go
   ```
4. Launch the Task Execution Nodes:
   ```
    go run cmd/executionnode/main.go
    ```
